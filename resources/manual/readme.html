                        <h2>Story</h2>
                        <p>The Dark Age has come. Wars, deceases, drought and plague brought people to the brink of dispair. Dire cult has arrived, preaching paradise through sacrifices. Demons (called Chewmans), satisfied with the gold and sacrifices, are to stop all calamities and suffering, and end the Dark Age. Believers built Unholy Mazes thoughout the country, places where demons are summoned and sacrifices are made. But the is light in this Dark Age. The Ancient Holy Orden, uniting knights, paladins and priesthood, stood against the Dire cult. They swear to clean the land from the demonic creatures and their followers, believing that demons are only bringing more disasters and destroying the world.</p>


                        <h2>How to Play</h2>
                        <p>Game is based on classic arcade games. You play as a Chewman, ancient demon, summoned to the Maze. Your main goal is to collect all coins or gems present on each level. You control Chewman by swiping left, right, up or down. To reach the goal you must avoid all enemies and traps on the level and find the way to collect all treasure, as it may be hidden in places unreachable by simple means. Each collected coin gives you 10 points. When all coins are collected you will proceed to the next level. Stars are awarded for either fast or no-death completion. 3 stars are awarded if player finishes the level without loosing any lives or by completing it within the time limit.</p>

                        <h2>Power-Ups</h2>
                        <p>You can collect power-ups by eating them. Once collected, the power-up activates immediately and causes an effect for some time.</p>
