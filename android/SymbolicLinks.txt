There are several symbolic links used to build android version of the game:
app/jni/SDL -> to SDL root folder
app/jni/src/Game -> to Game subfolder from this repository root
app/jni/src/SDL2 -> to SDL/include folder
app/jni/src/SVE -> to SVE subfolder from this repository root
app/src/main/java/org/libsdl/app -> to SDL built activity (SDL/android-project/app/src/main/java/org/libsdl/app)

Also app resources should be added into app/src/main/assets folder (i.e. it should contain "resources" subfolder)
